      <description>I am a paragraph in Markdown with line wrapping so fit in this width. I am a continuation of the first paragraph as there is no empty line before me.
I am the second paragraph.
I am the third one. Even though there are two line breaks before me, this does not create any newline characters. After me there are two spaces before the newline character.·· I have line break before me and even though I am not a new paragraph, I do start on a new line due to the manual line break via spaces before the newline character.</description>
