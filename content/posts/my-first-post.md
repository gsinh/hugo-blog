I am a paragraph in Markdown with line
wrapping so fit in this width.
I am a continuation of the first paragraph
as there is no empty line before me.

I am the second paragraph.


I am the third one. Even though there are
two line breaks before me, this does not
create any newline characters. After me there
are two spaces before the newline character.··
I have line break before me and even though
I am not a new paragraph, I do start on a
new line due to the manual line break via
spaces before the newline character.
